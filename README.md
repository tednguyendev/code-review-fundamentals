## Reviewing Pull Requests
- Code reviews: we know they [make our code better](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/). _How_ do we do code reviews? There’s less agreement on that.
- We have, in pairing, an _expectation_ is that the pair will _participate in implementing_ any alternative that they suggest.
- In fact, the state of pull request quality is _so bad_ that most advice I’ve read on how to do a good review _only_ addresses the idea that you shouldn’t insult someone’s code.
- They’re bad because they are delegating responsibility to the original developer to do both the feasibility test and the implementation of those ideas.
	- They’re recording their idea in such a way that they get credit if it works out, but the original implementer undertakes all the risk that it doesn’t.
- Current reading: In fact, in most pull request reviews, it is dead obvious to me that the reviewer did not pull down or run the code at all.
